# Terminal clocks

My home-made project. Clocks. Shows local time (time on your PC).

## Getting started

### How to compile
    gcc main.c
### How to run
    a.exe
    
### If you want to change character style
Change the <b>CHAR_NUMBERS</b> in <b>shapes.c</b> constant to the value you need

### Important
 * Do not try to launch it in the git bash. It will not work.
 * This app can heavily load the processor

## TODO
 * Need do better perfomance (while cycle consumes too much).
 * Need to add ability to print time in different colors.
